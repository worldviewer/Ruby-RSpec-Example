# Fill lib with code to build a car race.

# You should have:

# a Car class that can accelerate to a certain speed

# a Race class that, once instantiated, instantiates two 
# cars, and accelerates them to two random speeds

# an instance method on the Race class called winner that 
# returns the winning car

# an instance method on the Race class called loser that 
# returns the losing car

# At the end, you should be able to do:

# race = Race.new
# race.winner
# # => <Car ...>
# race.loser
# # => <Car ...>
